# 🌟 MERN Stack Learning Project

Welcome to my **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** learning project!  
This repository is dedicated to practicing **backend development** while building a complete MERN stack application.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to learn and apply **backend development** concepts by:

- Building a real-world server using Node.js and Express  
- Connecting to a MongoDB database  
- Creating RESTful APIs for CRUD operations  
- Securing routes with middleware for authentication  
- Integrating with a React frontend (planned in next steps)

---

## 📚 About the MERN Stack

**MERN** stands for:  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing JSON-like documents  
- **Express.js** – Backend web application framework for Node.js  
- **React.js** – Frontend library for building user interfaces  
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server  

---

## 🏗️ Current Project Status

- Setup Node.js and Express server  
- Connect to MongoDB database  
- Create REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- Implement basic middleware for authentication

# 📆 What I Learn Day by Day?

## 📌 Express.js Routes Practice

📚 **Learning Note:**  
Today I practiced the basics of Express.js, focusing on creating routes, using multiple route handlers, and understanding how Express middleware works.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Setting up a basic Express server
- Creating simple routes (GET, POST)
- Passing multiple route handlers (middleware)
- Sending responses in JSON or plain text
- Understanding the `next()` function

---

## 📚 What is Middleware in Express?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions can:

- Execute any code
- Modify the `req` and `res` objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware in the stack

In this, I practiced the use of **Express.js middleware** to handle basic user authentication. Middleware is a core concept in Express and is widely used for logging, error handling, request parsing, and—importantly—**authorization and authentication**.

# 🛡️ Express.js Error Handling Practice

This project demonstrates **error handling in Express.js**, focusing on:

✅ Using `try/catch` in asynchronous controllers  
✅ Centralized error-handling middleware  
✅ Wildcard 404 "Not Found" route handling  

It’s designed as a learning exercise for writing clean, robust, production-ready Express.js backends.

---

## 📚 Why Error Handling Matters

Error handling is essential in web development. It:

- Prevents server crashes
- Sends meaningful error responses to clients
- Helps with debugging
- Improves security by controlling what info is exposed

Express.js provides a powerful mechanism for **centralized error handling** using middleware.

# 🚀 Mongoose + MongoDB 

This project documents my learning on how to:

✅ Initialize Mongoose in a Node.js project  
✅ Connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster  
✅ Create a schema and model  
✅ Build a simple POST API to insert data into the database using Postman  
✅ View and explore data using MongoDB Compass
